# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Predicting telecom customer churn using ML models

# ðŸ“ž Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a telecom customer will churn (discontinue service) based on various customer attributes such as service usage, tenure, and contract details. The aim is to help businesses identify potential churners and take proactive retention actions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build an accurate machine learning model that predicts customer churn and provides insights into key factors influencing churn behavior.

## ðŸ§  Approach
- Conducted **data exploration and cleaning** to handle missing values and ensure data quality.  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify customer behavior patterns using visualizations.  
- Applied **feature engineering** techniques to prepare categorical and numerical variables.  
- Built and evaluated multiple classification models â€” **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.  
- Selected the best-performing model based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** metrics.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:** Feature Encoding, Data Balancing, Model Evaluation  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Customers with **shorter tenure** and **month-to-month contracts** were more likely to churn.  
- **Online security and technical support** availability significantly affected retention.  
- The **Random Forest model** achieved the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.

## ðŸš€ Results
- Achieved **~82% accuracy** using Random Forest.  
- Identified major churn drivers to help optimize retention strategies.  
- Delivered actionable insights through visual analysis of churn-prone customer groups.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in Repository
- `customer_churn.ipynb` â€“ main collab notebook containing code and analysis.  
- `data.csv` â€“ dataset used for training and evaluation (if available).  
- `README.md` â€“ detailed project documentation.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization
Key plots include:
- Churn distribution across tenure and contract types.  
- Feature importance graph highlighting churn predictors.  
- Confusion matrix for model performance evaluation.  

## ðŸ§© Future Scope
Planned improvements include:
- Implementing deep learning models to enhance prediction accuracy.  
- Developing an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights.
